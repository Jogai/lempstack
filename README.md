## Introduction
This repository hosts a setup script that simplies the installation of LEMP stack suitable(?) for shared-like Linux environments. 
Cloned from Aatish Neupane.

Optimized for gpEasy installations: https://github.com/oyejorge/gpEasy-CMS
Including more imagick packages.
No rewrite needed with this config for nice urls, just set define('gp_indexphp',false);
